Overview
This project delivers an on-chain casino smart contract stack designed to be resilient, auditable, and easy to extend. It aims to prove fairness through verifiable randomness, ensure transparency through on-chain state, and offer a wide range of games without sacrificing security or performance. The engine acts as the backbone, coordinating game modules, managing bets, handling payouts, and recording outcomes on chain. The modular approach lets teams mix and match games like Coinflip, Duel, Lottery, Plinko, Prediction, Crash, Dice, Roulette, Wheel, Mines, and Loot Box openings.

The engine is built with cross-chain capabilities in mind. While Solana remains a primary deployment target, the architecture is designed to plug into Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks, Monad, Sui, Abstract, and Ronin environments. The goal is to provide a unified contract layer that can be accessed by diverse front-ends and wallets, with minimal changes required per chain. The randomness layer uses ORAO VRF to deliver provably fair results. The VRF component is designed to be portable across supported chains, ensuring consistent fairness guarantees regardless of where players participate.

Why this project exists
- To deliver a provably fair casino experience on multiple chains without locking players into a single ecosystem.
- To provide a modular set of casino games that can be extended as new ideas arrive.
- To create a transparent and auditable betting environment where outcomes and state transitions are verifiable on-chain.
- To empower developers to build new front-ends and experiences on top of a solid, well-documented contract stack.
- To facilitate safer, auditable deployments through clear interfaces, robust tests, and open governance workflows.

Core principles
- Clarity over cleverness: simple, explicit contracts and interfaces where possible.
- Modularity: each game is a distinct module with a clear API.
- Provable fairness: on-chain randomness with verifiable proofs.
- Cross-chain compatibility: designed to work across several major ecosystems.
- Security by design: defensive coding, formal reasoning, and thorough testing.
- Open collaboration: easy contributions and straightforward release cycles.

Architecture at a glance
- On-chain casino core: handles bets, state transitions, payouts, and orchestrates game modules.
- Randomness layer: ORAO VRF integration to produce provably fair results with auditable proofs.
- Game modules: Coinflip, Duel, Lottery, Plinko, Prediction, Crash, Dice, Roulette, Wheel, Mines, Loot Box openings, and future additions.
- Cross-chain adapters: adapters or bridges that expose a uniform interface to different chain environments.
- Data layout: compact, deterministic state kept on-chain with clear event logs for auditing.
- Access control: role-based permissions and upgradeability paths that respect security constraints.
- Front-end integration: clean APIs and documentation to speed up UI development.

Supported chains and cross-chain approach
- Solana: primary host for on-chain state and high-throughput betting activity.
- EVM-compatible chains: supports Solidity-based adapters for cross-chain functionality and liquidity sharing.
- Monad: designed adapters to bridge the Monadic environment with the core engine.
- Sui: provides fresh runtime contexts for certain game modules while preserving core logic.
- Abstract: offers additional cross-chain routing and modularization surfaces.
- Ronin: enables integration with specialized environments, especially for asset routing and user experience on specific ecosystems.

The cross-chain approach centers on a single, well-defined on-chain interface for the casino core. Chains implement adapters that translate their native calls into the engineâ€™s standard API. This enables uniform game logic, consistent fairness guarantees, and cohesive event streams across ecosystems. The VRF component is designed to be chain-agnostic at the API layer while isolating chain-specific cryptographic interactions behind adapters. This ensures consistent probabilistic outcomes and verifiable proofs across ecosystems.

Game modules
- Coinflip: a classic binary bet with straightforward fairness checks.
- Duel: a head-to-head matchup mechanic with timing and staking rules.
- Lottery: a multi-party entry lottery with a transparent draw process.
- Plinko: a physics-inspired grid game with progressive payout multipliers.
- Prediction: players forecast outcomes and claim rewards based on accuracy.
- Crash: a multiplier-based game with a rolling coefficient and bust risk.
- Dice: classic dice rolling with customizable sides and bets.
- Roulette: digital roulette with standard wheel and payout structures.
- Wheel: spinning wheel with multiple segments and tiered payouts.
- Mines: grid-based exploration with hidden rewards and risks.
- Loot Box openings: a loot system offering randomized rewards with tiered odds.

Game logic design emphasizes:
- Clear interfaces: each game module exposes a minimal, stable API for bets, outcomes, and payouts.
- Deterministic state transitions: every change is driven by explicit, auditable on-chain rules.
- Fairness checks: every game includes validation hooks that auditors can reproduce off-chain.
- Extensibility: new game types can plug into the engine with minimal changes to core code.

How randomness is achieved
- Randomness comes from ORAO VRF, a verifiable random function designed for blockchain use.
- The VRF produces randomness seed material that is posted on-chain, along with proofs that players and auditors can verify.
- Each game module consumes a seed in a deterministic fashion to determine outcomes, ensuring reproducibility for audits.
- The architecture isolates VRF logic behind a deterministic interface so the core engine remains chain-agnostic at the API level.

Smart contract interfaces
- CasinoCore.sol (Solana equivalent in Rust or cross-chain-agnostic interface): the main orchestration layer for bets, state, and payouts.
- GameModule interfaces: standardized traits or interfaces for Coinflip, Duel, Lottery, and other games.
- VRFProvider interface: a portable API for requesting randomness and receiving proofs.
- Wallet and user accounts: a minimal, secure model that tracks stake, balances, and entitlements.
- Admin and governance: access-controlled endpoints for upgrades and parameter tuning.

Data model and storage
- Bets: each bet record stores player, amount, chosen game, parameters, and a link to the outcome seed.
- Game state: per-game module state that tracks ongoing bets, rounds, and payouts.
- Payouts: deterministic payout calculations recorded on-chain and emitted as events.
- VRF proofs: the source of randomness stored or verifiably derivable for each outcome.
- Events: a robust event schema captures all important actions for off-chain indexing and audits.

Development setup
- Prerequisites: a modern Rust toolchain, Solana toolchain, and Node.js for front-end integration. For cross-chain components, you may need Solidity tooling and cross-chain SDKs depending on the target chain.
- Repository layout: core contracts, adapters, game modules, tests, scripts, and documentation.
- Build and test: a unified workflow that builds the core, runs unit tests for modules, and executes integration tests that simulate cross-chain interactions.
- Linting and formatting: consistent style guides to keep code readable and maintainable.

Running locally
- Start with a local test network for the target chain (Solana or EVM, depending on the module you want to test).
- Deploy the casino core to the local network.
- Install and configure a VRF provider simulator if you want to avoid external dependencies during tests.
- Run the test suite to verify correctness of bets, outcomes, and payouts under different scenarios.
- Use sample front-end scripts to place bets and observe the end-to-end flow.

Security and risk considerations
- Threat model: the core concern is the integrity of randomness, bet handling, and payout calculations. The VRF provider is a critical trust point, so the integration must be verifiable and auditable.
- Upgrades: upgrade paths should be carefully controlled with governance to prevent unauthorized changes to core logic or randomness sources.
- Data integrity: ensure that all bets, outcomes, and payouts are recorded deterministically and cannot be forged after the fact.
- Cross-chain risk: adapters introduce additional surfaces for attack. Each adapter must validate inputs, preserve semantics, and maintain consistent state across chains.
- Audit readiness: the architecture emphasizes deterministic state transitions and transparent event logging to facilitate independent audits.

Testing strategy
- Unit tests: per-module tests verify core betting logic, payout calculations, and state updates.
- Integration tests: end-to-end tests simulate bet placement, VRF requests, and payout settlements across simulated chains.
- Fuzz testing: stress-test the engine with unexpected parameters to ensure stability and boundary safety.
- Security testing: edge-case tests for overflow, reentrancy (where applicable), and access control checks.
- Benchmarking: measure transaction costs and latency for critical paths to ensure performance remains acceptable under load.

Quality and governance
- Documentation-driven development: every interface has clear docs, examples, and usage notes.
- CI/CD: automated builds and tests on PRs, with status checks before merging.
